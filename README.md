# 2nd Capstone Project at Tech Elevator

In this project I pair programmed with a partner to create an application that allowed users to log into their accounts and transfer funds. We created a RESTful API server and command-line application to do so. (essentially a CLI version of Venmo)

Users are capable or checking their account balance, sending funds, requesting funds, view pending and past transfers, as well as view transfer details. 

This work was done after 7 weeks of class lectures.
